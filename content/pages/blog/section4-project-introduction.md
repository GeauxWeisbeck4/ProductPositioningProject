# Product Positioning Project

> Welcome to my project page for the Section 4 Product Positioning Sprint, taught by April Dunford. This sprint explores on of the most abstract and difficult topics for many businesses to grasp and execute on successfully. For my project, I decided to choose a company that I would like to work at because I find their product fascinating, yet I couldn't figure out who exactly would buy this product and I thought that examining it through the scope of product positioning would help me better understand this and that it may potentially be helpful to Stackbit if they didn't already understand their positioning.

> I hope you find my work useful and that it may benefit Stackbit in improving their product positioning. Read on to learn more and don't forget to check out each module page and blog post to learn more about this project.

This post will be updated in the near future as I finish up this project. But it is a brief introduction into the project. Think of it as my first slide :)

I am strapped for time to finish the project, so if you are reading this, please check out each module page for more information, or you can read through the blog posts in order for more of a presentation like experience. This site will be continually updated into the future, so I urge you to check in from time to time to keep up to date with the latest on this ongoing project!
